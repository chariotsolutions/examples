This repository contains examples for Chariot blog posts. It exists because [organization gists are not a
thing](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/7923).

At the top level of the repository you'll find directories named after the blog post URL path, with a date
prefix (eg: `20231030-java-virtual-threads`).  Each directory will contain one or more files referenced by
the post, and possibly a README if more instructions are needed.
